deconvolution
*************
A Python module providing Deconvolution class that implements and generalises Ruifrok-Johnston color deconvolution algorithm [RJ]_, [IJ]_. It allows one to split an image into distinct color layers in just
a few lines of code:

.. code:: python

  from deconvolution import Deconvolution
  from PIL import Image

  img = Image.open("image.jpg")
  
  # Declare an instance of Deconvolution, with image loaded and with color basis defining what layers are interesting
  decimg = Deconvolution(image=img, basis=[[1, 0.1, 0.2], [0, 0.1, 0.8]])
  
  # Constructs new PIL Images, with different color layers
  layer1, layer2 = decimg.out_images(mode=[1, 2])


Installation
------------
To install the package run:

.. code:: bash

  make install


Testing
-------
.. code:: bash
  
  # For Python 3 users
  make test
  
  # For Python 2 users
  make comp

  # Check the code coverage
  make coverage

  # Check the coverage interactively, using a web browser
  make html
